### I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in data science at RIT, specializing in data analysis, machine learning, and AI. I have practical experience in Python and R through various projects and hold a Google Data Analytics Professional certification. As a graduate teaching assistant, I assist in teaching database design and SQL at RIT. I excel in data visualization, using Python libraries and Tableau to convey insights effectively. Additionally, I have frontend development experience, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, further enhancing my skills in this area.
